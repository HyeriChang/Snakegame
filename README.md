# Snakegame

1.	Agent (Snake):

The snake in the game can be considered the agent. It "perceives" the environment through user inputs (arrow keys) that control its movement.
The snake decides where to move based on its current state (position and direction) and the user's inputs.

2.	Environment:
   
The game board represents the environment. It includes the snake, the food, and the boundaries.
The snake interacts with the environment by moving and growing when it consumes food.

3.	Actions:

The agent's (snake) actions are determined by user inputs (arrow keys). The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
The agent's actions influence the transitions between different states in the state space.

4.	Rewards and Goals:
   
The game has implicit rewards and goals. The snake receives a positive reward when it consumes food and grows longer.
The agent aims to maximize its score by consuming food and avoiding collisions with itself or the boundaries.

5.	Learning (User Interaction):

While the provided code does not include learning mechanisms, agents might learn from their interactions with the environment in more advanced AI applications. For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm could be used to train a snake agent to optimize its decisions over time.

6.	Game Loop and Decision Making:

The game loop continuously updates the state of the environment, handles user inputs, and checks for collisions or events.
The snake's decision-making process involves responding to user inputs and avoiding collisions.

7.	Collision Detection:

The game includes collision detection mechanisms to check if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries. Collisions impact the game's state and can lead to the end of the game.
